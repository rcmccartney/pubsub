To run the PubSub program first extract source files then open a shell and type:

$ rmiregistry [port] &    //port is optional
$ java EventServer [-host <hostName>] [-p <portnumber>]  //optional command-line arguments

The port number must match what you used for the rmiregistry.  Then, to connect with a PubSubAgent, run

$ java PubSubClient [-l] [-host <hostName>] [-p <portnumber>]

The hostName must match what the server is running on.  If you are using two terminals on the same machine,
this argument is not needed.  The portnumber must match what the server and rmiregistry used.
Use -l to load a previously saved Client (to show asynchronousity)


Example run:
(On buddy.cs.rit.edu)
$ rmiregistry &
$ java EventServer

(On a different machine)
$ java PubSubClient -host buddy.cs.rit.edu

To run the Stock Exchange the commands are similar but follow the following example:

Example run:
(On buddy.cs.rit.edu)
$ rmiregistry &
$ java StockMarketManager

(On a different machine)
$ java Seller -host buddy.cs.rit.edu
$ java Buyer -host buddy.cs.rit.edu
